Game-Cpp

Intended to begin understanding how games development is done in C++ without the use of a games engin such as unity or unreal. I am useing the tutorials from https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhfAbcv9cehhkG7ZQK0nfIGJC_C-wSLrx to try and get to grips with it. this is not an origonal work and should not be concidered as such. 

There may be subtile changes from the origonal as and when i see it to change the code. In the first instance it is to keep the declerations and the defanition of methods in there proper place. no inline decarations.
